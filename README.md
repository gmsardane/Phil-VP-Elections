# Phil-VP-Elections

An analysis of the [May 2016 Philippine  General Elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_presidential_election,_2016) results transmission. 
First published as a [Facebook note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/gen-n-aris-sardane-calamba/bongbong-leni-and-benford-an-analysis-on-the-philippine-vice-presidential-race/10153818025948051), 
and now is also hosted on [adalace.org](http://www.adalace.org/posts/ipython-notebook/).

The analysis used data scraped from a Philippine news website compiled [here](http://www.adalace.org/posts/ipython-notebook/). 
We used Benford's Law of first digits to show that allegations of electoral [fraud](http://time.com/4327269/ferdinand-marcos-junior-bongbong-vice-president/) by Bongbong Marcos is unlikely.
